# UserStoryIntegration Architecture Documentation

## Architecture Overview

UserStoryIntegration follows the Clean Architecture principles to maintain separation of concerns and ensure the system remains testable, maintainable, and scalable. The application is designed to consume various Language Model (LLM) providers and expose a unified API for client applications.

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies only point inward, with domain layer having no dependencies on outer layers
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data access
3. **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
4. **Framework Independence**: The core business logic is not dependent on external frameworks

## Layers

### 1. Domain Layer

The innermost layer containing enterprise-wide business rules and entities.

**Key Components:**
- Domain Entities
- Repository Interfaces
- Domain Events
- Domain Exceptions
- Value Objects

The domain layer has no dependencies on outer layers or external libraries, ensuring that business rules are not affected by UI or infrastructure changes.

### 2. Application Layer

Contains application-specific business rules and orchestrates the flow of data between the outer layers and the domain.

**Key Components:**
- CQRS Commands & Handlers
- CQRS Queries & Handlers
- DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
- Application Services
- Validators
- Interfaces for Infrastructure Services

The application layer depends only on the domain layer and defines interfaces that are implemented by the infrastructure layer.

### 3. Infrastructure Layer

Provides implementations for the interfaces defined in the inner layers.

**Key Components:**
- LLM Service Adapters
- Repository Implementations
- Database Context
- External Service Clients
- Persistence Configurations
- Logging Implementation

The infrastructure layer contains concrete implementations for database access, external service integration, and other technical concerns.

### 4. API Layer

The outermost layer that interacts with client applications.

**Key Components:**
- Controllers
- Middleware
- Filters
- Swagger Documentation
- Health Checks
- API Endpoint Configuration

The API layer depends on the application layer and does not directly interact with the domain or infrastructure layers.

## LLM Integration Architecture

The LLM integration follows the Adapter pattern to support multiple LLM providers:

1. **ILLMService Interface**: Defines the contract for LLM interactions
2. **LLMAdapterService**: Coordinates the selection of the appropriate LLM provider
3. **LLMAdapterFactory**: Creates the specific adapter based on the requested model
4. **Provider-Specific Adapters**: Implement the ILLMService interface for each LLM provider:
   - OpenAIAdapter
   - AnthropicAdapter
   - GoogleAIAdapter

This design allows the system to seamlessly switch between different LLM providers without affecting the business logic.

## Data Flow

1. Client sends a request to the API
2. Controller receives the request and passes it to the application layer
3. Application layer processes the request using domain entities and business rules
4. If external LLM services are needed, the application layer uses the ILLMService interface
5. The infrastructure layer's implementation of ILLMService communicates with the external LLM provider
6. Results are passed back through the layers to the client

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Logging**: Implemented using Serilog
- **Exception Handling**: Global exception middleware
- **Health Monitoring**: Health check endpoints for API, database, and external services
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based authentication
- **Resiliency**: Polly for HTTP resilience policies

## Deployment Architecture

The application is designed to be deployed as a containerized microservice with the following characteristics:

- REST API exposed for client applications
- SQL Server database for persistence
- External dependencies on LLM provider APIs
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Swagger UI for API documentation and testing

## Security Considerations

- API key management for LLM providers
- JWT authentication for API endpoints
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- CORS policy configuration
- Input validation using FluentValidation

## Performance Considerations

- Caching responses from LLM providers
- Database indexing strategy
- Pooled HTTP connections to external services
- Asynchronous processing of long-running operations
